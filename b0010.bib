abstract = {This paper shows that pair-distribution function (PDF) analyses can be carried out on organic and organometallic compounds from powder electron diffraction data. Different experimental setups are demonstrated, including selected area electron diffraction and nanodiffraction in transmission electron microscopy or nanodiffraction in scanning transmission electron microscopy modes. The methods were demonstrated on organometallic complexes (chlorinated and unchlorinated copper phthalocyanine) and on purely organic compounds (quinacridone). The PDF curves from powder electron diffraction data, called ePDF, are in good agreement with PDF curves determined from X-ray powder data demonstrating that the problems of obtaining kinematical scattering data and avoiding beam damage of the sample are possible to resolve.},

abstract = {This study addresses the use of an industry by-product, carbide slag (CS), to activate another industry by-product, ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS), for soft clay stabilization in comparison to Portland cement (PC). The properties of CS-GGBS stabilized clays were investigated through unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that the optimum CS content for the CS-GGBS stabilized clay to yield the highest UCS was 4\%-6\%, varying slightly with curing age and GGBS content. The UCS of the optimum CS-GGBS stabilized clays was more than twice that of the corresponding PC stabilized clays. The main hydration products detected for the CS-GGBS stabilized clays included calcium silicate hydrates (CSH), calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH), and alumino-ferrite monosulfate (AFm).},

@book{Chichilnisky2015,
abstract = {Classic probability theory treats rare events as ‘outliers’ that are disregarded and underestimated. In a moment of change however rare events can become frequent, and frequent events rare. We postulate new axioms for probability theory that require a balanced treatment of rare and frequent events, based on what we call “the topology of change”. The axioms extend the foundation of probability to integrate rare but potentially catastrophic events or black swans: natural hazards, market crashes, catastrophic climate change and episodes of species extinction. The new results include a characterization of a family of purely finitely additive measures that are—somewhat surprisingly—absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This is a newdevelopment from an earlier characterization of probability measures implied by the new axioms, which where countably additive measures created in Chichilnisky (2000), Wiley, Chichester (2002), Chichilnisky (2009, 2009a). The results are contrasted to the axioms of Kolmogorov (1933/1950), De Groot (1970/2004), Arrow (1971), Dubins and Savage (1965), Savage (1972), Von Neumann and Morgernstern (1944), and Hernstein and Milnor.},

@article{Sweet2014,
abstract = {Satellite studies of the terrestrial Arctic report increased summer greening and longer overall growing and peak seasons since the 1980s, which increases productivity and the period of carbon uptake. These trends are attributed to increasing air temperatures and reduced snow cover duration in spring and fall. Concurrently, deciduous shrubs are becoming increasingly abundant in tundra landscapes, which may also impact canopy phenology and productivity. Our aim was to determine the influence of greater deciduous shrub abundance on tundra canopy phenology and subsequent impacts on net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) during the growing and peak seasons in the arctic foothills region of Alaska. We compared deciduous shrub-dominated and evergreen/graminoid-dominated community-level canopy phenology throughout the growing season using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used a tundra plant-community-specific leaf area index (LAI) model to estimate LAI throughout the green season and a tundra-specific NEE model to estimate the impact of greater deciduous shrub abundance and associated shifts in both leaf area and canopy phenology on tundra carbon flux. We found that deciduous shrub canopies reached the onset of peak greenness 13 days earlier and the onset of senescence 3 days earlier compared to evergreen/graminoid canopies, resulting in a 10-day extension of the peak season. The combined effect of the longer peak season and greater leaf area of deciduous shrub canopies almost tripled the modeled net carbon uptake of deciduous shrub communities compared to evergreen/graminoid communities, while the longer peak season alone resulted in 84\% greater carbon uptake in deciduous shrub communities. These results suggest that greater deciduous shrub abundance increases carbon uptake not only due to greater leaf area, but also due to an extension of the period of peak greenness, which extends the period of maximum carbon uptake.},

abstract = {The growing neuroscientific understanding of the biological basis of behaviors has profound social and ethical implications. To address the need for public awareness of the consequences of these advances, we developed an undergraduate neuroethics course, Neuroscience and Society, at the University of Minnesota. Course evolution, objectives, content, and impact are described here. To engage all students and facilitate undergraduate ethics education, this course employed daily reading, writing, and student discussion, case analysis, and team presentations with goals of fostering development of moral reasoning and judgment and introducing application of bioethical frameworks to topics raised by neuroscience. Pre- and post-course Defining Issues Test (DIT) scores and student end-of-course reflections demonstrated that course objectives for student application of bioethical frameworks to neuroethical issues were met. The active-learning, student-centered pedagogical approaches used to achieve these goals serve as a model for how to effectively teach neuroethics at the undergraduate level.},
